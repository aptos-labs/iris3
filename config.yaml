# Keys:

# projects: Only resources in these projects will get labeled.
# But if the value is empty, *all* projects in the organization are included.
projects: []

# plugins: Only these plugins are enabled.
# For example, add some of these to the list:
#     bigquery, buckets, disks,  cloudsql, instances, snapshots, subscriptions, topics
# But if the value is empty, *all* plugins are enabled.

# iris_prefix plus underscore is prefixed to the key of each label that is added.
#    If empty string is used (the default), then there is no prefix.
iris_prefix: iris

# specific_prefixes gives a prefix per resource type, overriding iris_prefix.
# The default is that there is no override.
# For an example, see the comment below.
# Null (missing) value vs empty-string:
#  - A null (missing) value, as in the Buckets example below,
#   will not replace the general iris_prefix.
#  -  Empty string as "", as in the Bigquery example below, overrides
#   the iris_prefix, so that you get labels with no prefix.

# Example:
# specific_prefixes:
#   Buckets:

#   Snapshots:
#   Subscriptions:

# If from_project is True, then for each resource we are labeling, copy the labels from its project onto it.
# The default is False.
from_project: True

# If label_all_on_cron is False (the default), then to save money,
#  only resources of certain types get labeled on cron: those whose plugins either
#    - return True on relabel_on_cron() (like Disks)
#    - or return False in is_labeled_on_creation() (like Cloud SQL)
# If it isTrue, then all resource types will be labeled on every Cloud Scheduler cycle.
#   This is useful for labeling existing resources when you first launch Iris3.

label_all_on_cron: False

# Optionally change this token before first deployment for added security in
# communication between PubSub and the Iris App on App Engine.
# You could even re-generate a new token per deployment.
# Note that this token-based approach is not very secure, though it  was once recommended by Google.
# However, so long as the GCP project running the Iris3 AppEngine service is otherwise secure,
# this token protects against unwanted invocations of labeling.

# If running in a project with one of the strings in the name,
# then scheduled labelings will fail if more than 3 projects are enabled.
